### About me

Hello, my name is Vinicius and currently I am a software engineering student at [42 SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/).

I am very interested in creative code, languages, cognitive science, thinking about new ways of teaching computer programming and human-computer interaction.

### About 42 school

Here you will find some of the projects I have already finished:

[libft](https://github.com/viniseneda/libft): my first library written in C and the "get next line" function
