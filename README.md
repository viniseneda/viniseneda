### About me

Hello, my name is Vinicius and currently I am a software engineering student at [42 SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/).

I am very interested in creative code, languages, cognitive science, thinking about new ways of teaching computer programming and human-computer interaction.

### About 42 school

Here you will find some of the projects I have already finished:

[libft](https://github.com/viniseneda/libft): my first library written in C and the "get next line" function

[ft_printf](https://github.com/viniseneda/ft_printf): implementation of a prinft function

[mini_RT](https://github.com/viniseneda/miniRT): a simple ray tracer written in C

[pipex](https://github.com/viniseneda/pipex): an implementation of the pipe function from shell

[minishell](https://github.com/viniseneda/minishell): an simple implementation of a linux shell

### Other projects

Currently very interested in learning funcional programming. Trying to make a version of [MAL](https://github.com/kanaka/mal), the Clojure inspired Lisp interpreter.
